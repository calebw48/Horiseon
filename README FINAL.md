# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage that meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
    -I replaced the DIV tags with SECTION tags, replaced a DIV tag with NAV tag, replaced a DIV tag with HEADER tag.
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
    -I organized the code so that it has a logical structure by making sure MAIN tag was aligned with closing MAIN tag and that SECTION A and SECTION B were in line as well.
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
    -I ensured that each img element has an alt attribute with a description of the image.
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN I find that they fall in sequential order
    -I ensured that Headings are used properly. Corrected Footer <h2> to <p> and added class attribute to maintain style.
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
    -Changed title from "website" to "Horiseon - A Marketing Company"
